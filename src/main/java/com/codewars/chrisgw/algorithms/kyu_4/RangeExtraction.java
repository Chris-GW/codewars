/**
 * A format for expressing an ordered list of integers is to use a comma separated list of either
 * <p>
 * * individual integers
 * * or a range of integers denoted by the starting integer separated from the end integer in the range by a dash, '-'. The range includes all integers in the interval including both endpoints.  It is not considered a range unless it spans at least 3 numbers. For example ("12, 13, 15-17")
 * <p>
 * Complete the solution  so that it takes a list of integers in increasing order and returns a correctly formatted string in the range format.
