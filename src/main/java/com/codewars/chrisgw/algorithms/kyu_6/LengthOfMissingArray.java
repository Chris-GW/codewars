/**
 * You get an array of arrays.<br>
 * If you sort the arrays by their length, you will see, that their length-values are consecutive.<br>
 * But one array is missing!<br>
 * <br><br>
 * You have to write a method, that return the length of the missing array.<br>
 * ```
 * Example:
 * [[1, 2], [4, 5, 1, 1], [1], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]] --> 3
 * ```
 * <br>
 * 
 * If the array of arrays is null/nil or empty, the method should return 0.<br>
 * 
 * When an array in the array is null or empty, the method should return 0 too!<br>
 * There will always be a missing element and its length will be always between the given arrays.
 * <br><br>
 * Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)<br> 
 * <br>
 * I have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.
