/**

 * <p>
 * Write a method that takes an array of consecutive (increasing) letters as input and that returns the missing letter in the array.
 * <p>
 * You will always get an valid array. And it will be always exactly one letter be missing. The length of the array will always be at least 2.<br>
 * The array will always contain letters in only one case.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * ```
 * ['a','b','c','d','f'] -> 'e'
 * ['O','Q','R','S'] -> 'P'
 * ```
 * <p>
 * (Use the English alphabet with 26 letters!)
 * <p>
 * Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)
 * <p>
 * I have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!
